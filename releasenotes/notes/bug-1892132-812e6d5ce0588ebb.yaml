    Linux kernel 5.8 changed the sysfs interface that is used to
    discover the interfaces used for OVS offloads for certain NIC
    models. This results in network plugging failure, as described
    in `bug #1892132`_. This release fixes the plugging issue by
    properly handling the new sysfs structure.
